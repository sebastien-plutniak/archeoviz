Released: 2023-06-07

* URL parameters are now supported, including the following parameters: objects.df, refits.df, timeline.df, title, home.text, reverse.axis.values, reverse.square.names, square.size, add.x.square.labels, add.y.square.labels, class.variable, class.values, default.group, location.mode, map.density, map.refits, plot3d.hulls, plot3d.surfaces, plot3d.refits, sectionX.refits, sectionY.refits, run.plots

# archeoViz 1.1.2
Released: 2023-06-03

# archeoViz 1.1.1
Released: 2023-05-15

* Change in the 'location' menu: add a third option to visualise spatial uncertainty in the location of the objects (as lines, plans, volumes). Consequently, chage in the pssible values for the 'location' parameter ('exact.fuzzy' is replaced by 'show.uncertainty').
* In the 'Tables' tab, the types of spatial uncertainty can now be displayed in the tables.
* Bugs fixed: activating the immediate display of the refitting lines (with the parameters 'map.refits', 'sectionX.refits', 'sectionX.refits') failed and has been fixed.

# archeoViz 1.0.2
Released: 2023-05-04

* In the '3D plot', only the refitting lines related to the objects included in the data subset are displayed.
* Fixing issues in the generation of the R command in the 'reproducibility' tab.
* Add a table with details about the clicked point in the 'Map', 'Section X', and 'Section Y' tabs (using knitr::kable(), what adds a dependency to knitr).
* Add support for HTML in the tables showing details about the clicked point.
* Add buttons to export the plots as HTML widgets in the 'Map', 'Section X', and 'Section Y' tabs.

# archeoViz 1.0.1

* In the '3D plot' tab, add a button to download the 3D plot widget as HTML file.
* Add 'Italian'/'it' as an option for the 'lang' parameter in the 'archeoViz()' function.
* Various fixes, concerning the squares labels, the display of the summary tables.
